            <h2>Fast Fashion</h2>
            <p>Fast fashion is the approach to designing,
            creating, and producing products based
            on fast moving trends and cheap prices
            (such as H&M and Zara). These brands
            have perfected bringing runway knockoffs
            to stores at affordable prices. While cheap
            and trendy, fast fashion is dangerous
            because it results in overproduction,
            waste, environmental degradation, and the
            overworking of factory makers.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="word 2">
            <h2>Slow Fashion</h2>
            <p>Slow fashion is the opposite of fast fashion, a
            deliberate choice from consumers to slow down
            their consumption, and buy less, while investing in
            high quality pieces that last longer. It is the ethos of
            “buying fewer better things”, embracing individual
            style rather than chasing trends.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="word 3">
            <h2>Sustainable Fashion</h2>
            <p>This term usually means eco-friendly practices in the fashion
                industry, referencing the approach of designing, producing and
                consuming clothes that respect the planet by causing little to no
                damage, and therefore sustaining the environment. It also refers to
                the practice of recycling and reusing the product to extend its life.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="word 4">
            <h2>Ethical</h2>
            <p>The term ‘ethical’ usually refers to the people aspect of the manufacturing
                process. Many fashion brands simply define ethical production as adhering
                to local labor laws. Sometines, this is not good enough because our clothes
                are often made in places where labor laws are weak and enforcement is even
                weaker. Instead of asking, “Is this product doing no harm to the people who
                made it,” reframe the question to ask, “Is this product leaving the people who
                make it better off?”. Ethical means brands committed to treating their makers
                with fairness, respect, and care.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="word 5">
            <h2>Organic</h2>
            <p>Organic products are those produced
                without the use of chemical fertilizers,
                pesticides, or other artificial chemicals.
                The term ‘organic’ generally has a
                positive context, but just because a
                product is organic does not make it
                ethical. For example organic cotton
                could have still be picked by a child.
                Organic also doesn’t account for added
                toxins (such as dyes) that maybe used
                later in the production process, that has
                negative health impacts on both makers
                and consumers.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="word 6">
            <h2>Fair Trade</h2>
            <p>According to Fairtrade International, the Fairtrade Standards are designed to address the
                imbalance of power and injustices in trading relationships. Fair Trade provides an alternative
                to conventional trade, with fair trade products charging a premium to consumers so that
                producers (such as farmers) can earn a better living. While fair trade is a step in the right
                direction, it is not the same as living wages, which is what people would need to make
                to actually live with dignity. Moreover fair trade in fashion is more complicated than food
                because the fashion supply chain is more fragmented. For example the cotton in a fashion
                product maybe fair trade, but the factories where the clothes are cut and stitched may not.
                Gets confusing pretty quickly right?</p>
        </div>
        <div id="word 7">
            <h2>Living Wage</h2>
            <p>A living wage is a fair salary or
                compensation that allows makers
                to make a decent salary and not
                remain trapped in poverty. The
                Asia Floor Wage calculates living
                wages based on some common
                factors including: the number of
                family members being supported,
                the nutritional needs of a maker
                and their dependents, and their
                other basic needs including
                housing and education.</p>
