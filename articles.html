        <h1>The Ethics of Fashion During Climate Change</h1>
        <img id="ethics-heroshot" src="images/StellaMcCartney-img4.png" alt="Model leaning on giant globe">
    
        <p>The companies at the top of the fashion pyramid
spent much of the fall previewing their luxury wares for
spring 2020 and making their semiannual argument
for the value of beauty, craftsmanship, and lots and lots
of stuff. In their pursuit of the next new thing to entice
consumers, editors and retailers left a giant carbon
footprint as they jetted from New York to London, Milan
to Paris. Sustainability was not always front of mind for
many of them, but it was nonetheless there in the offhand
comments about the inherent waste of runway show
sets, the luxury market’s growing exasperation with fast
fashion and the existential angst that fashion was little
more than white noise in a cacophonous news cycle.</p>
<p>Amid the anxiety, a lot of the clothes presented
on the runways and in showrooms were emblematic of
ready-to-wear at its most creative and daring, as well as
classics of the highest caliber. In Paris, Valentino designer
Pierpaolo Piccioli deployed his exquisite eye for color
to create Day-Glo gowns that exuded elegance and
dresses with fauvist appliqué. At Alexander McQueen,
creative director Sarah Burton made a conscious
decision to focus on the crafts of dressmaking and
tailoring, and to support the small, artisanal textile houses
and mills throughout the United Kingdom. Her spring
collection was full of intricate embroideries, hand-cut silk
organza and crochet. And in New York, Mary-Kate Olsen
and Ashley Olsen distilled fashion to its simplest form
with a collection of trousers, coats and pristine shirts that
ignore the ebb and flow of trends.</p>
<p>There’s something that recommends all these
clothes: beauty, quality, utility. But in the world of
everyday consumers, people are asking: Are there any
clothes that are both guiltless and desirable? Is it possible
to buy fashion that does not imperil the environment?</p>
<p>The sustainability puzzle is the problem that
affects every corner of the fashion industry. Fashion’s
global production chain pollutes the environment.
Its factories, pushed to their limit, too often abuse an
overwhelmingly female workforce. Because fashion’s
fundamental operating principle rests on planned
obsolescence, brands are in a ceaseless cycle of
replacement and replenishment. Fashion’s job is to goad
you into wanting, needing more.</p>
<p>None of this is lost on its practitioners. As the
industry works to convince consumers that life will be
that much better with another pair of special-edition
sneakers or a hand-painted party dress, it’s also making
sustainability part of its business models. The two largest
luxury conglomerates, the Paris-based Kering Group and
LVMH, have both made commitments to reduce their
carbon footprints and their water consumption, better
preserve raw materials and improve waste management.
LVMH has invested in safeguarding the Amazon and in
renewable energy. Kering has made a commitment to
being carbon neutral across its supply chain.
“When it comes to climate change, we can no
longer wait to take real action,” said François-Henri Pinault,
chairman and CEO of Kering, in a statement this fall. “While
we focus on avoiding and reducing our [greenhouse gas]
emissions to meet our Science-Based Target, we will offset
all our remaining emissions and support the conservation
of vital forests and biodiversity around the world.”</p>
<p>In New York, longtime environmental advocate
Eileen Fisher has shared her expertise in circular design
with the street style brand Public School. (Her company
collaborated with Public School on a collection in 2018.)
Designer Gabriela Hearst has shifted to biodegradable
packaging and often uses fabric remnants from high-end
textile mills in her production to reduce waste. “People
say, ‘Oh you know we need to save the planet.’ No, no,
no. Obviously you do not expose yourself to nature,”
Hearst said to The Washington Post earlier this year. “You
think you’re going to save the planet? Nature is a natural
force. We are going to get exterminated.”</p>

<p>Consumers are also considering their culpability
in the climate crisis. Ask a basic question about how
to be a more deliberate shopper and you will quickly
learn so few of them have clear-cut answers. Is it better
to buy organic cotton or to buy cotton that’s grown
locally? Organic is generally better. But doesn’t cotton
production require an overabundance of water? Yes,
but only because conventional cotton has been bred
that way. Is fake fur a bigger burden on the environment
than real fur? No, but you’ll still want to consider how that
faux pelt is made. Just how bad is cashmere? Well, that’s
complicated, but wool is arguably a better choice. What
about carbon offsets? The math gets a little fuzzy.
Because fashion’s fundamental operating principle rests
on planned obsolescence, brands are in a ceaseless
cycle of replacement and replenishment. Fashion’s job is
to goad you into wanting, needing more.</p>
<p>The simplest answer to a shopper’s dilemma
might be a paraphrase of the advice that food writer
Michael Pollan offered to those of us perplexed by our
mealtime choices: Buy clothes. Not too many. Mostly
plant-based.</p>
<p>It is possible to buy something as simple as a white shirt,
that wardrobe staple, whose production has a minimal
impact on the environment and whose manufacture
upholds fair labor practices — one that is also stylish.</p>
<p>In her recent book, “Fashionopolis: The Price of
Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes,” Dana Thomas
explores the mess that the industry has made of the
environment through its emphasis on disposable fashion
and production chains that stretch halfway around the
globe. A perfect white shirt, Thomas says in an interview,
would be cut from organic cotton so that it could be
composted without releasing toxins into the soil. It would
have mother-of-pearl buttons, no plastic collar stays, and
it would be roomy enough to be worn with its shirttails
hanging but sleek enough to tuck into a pencil skirt.</p>
<p>Thomas, who is based in Paris, believes that she
has found something very close to the perfect white shirt
— one that she has worn in front of audiences as she
has embarked on a book tour because she knew that
the first question people would ask would be: What are
you wearing?</p>
<p>She has favored a white cotton shirt from
Stella McCartney, a brand that was built on the
idea that luxury fashion can also be gentle on the
environment and that eschews both fur and leather.
Thomas’s shirt cost about $550.</p>
<p>She recognizes that most people can’t afford
to spend hundreds of dollars on a white shirt, and that
even those who can pay that much often refuse to do
so. But shoppers should understand that sustainability is
about more than just the cost of the raw materials used
by a clothing company, says designer DooRi Chung,
who teaches fashion design at Marist College in New
York. “It’s about the supply chain,” Chung says, and that
includes “how you treat your workers.”</p>
<p>If the fashion industry paid factory workers for
the true value of their labor and was as mindful of its
environmental footprint as it should be, Thomas says,
then several hundred dollars is precisely what a highquality
white shirt should cost. But instead of buying 10
shirts, customers should simply buy one.</p>
<p>This argument is not new, but Thomas underscores our outsize consumption habits by pointing
to the fact that we have been enabled by clothing
prices that have never been lower. The original Diane
von Furstenberg wrap dress, which appeared on the
cover of Newsweek in 1976 and was hailed as fashion
salvation for working women, was priced at about $75.
That translates to about $340 today — a dollar figure that
would make a lot of women balk. But a shopper today 
doesn’t even have to spend that much on a wrap dress.
She can buy a new one for only $248. At full price.
In the 1950s, a man’s suit cost around $45. That’s
the equivalent of about $430 today. A shopper can walk
into H&M and buy a suit in the men’s department for a
mere $105. Zara has them for $150. One from J. Crew
totals $428. Again, that’s all at regular prices. And in a
retail environment when every day there’s a discount,
who pays full price anymore?</p>
<p>Since the post-World War II years, the price of
clothing relative to the median household income has
fallen while prices for housing, health care and cars
have risen. Clothing prices, to be sure, are not the only
items to become less expensive: Food prices have fallen
significantly in the past 30 years, particularly the cost
of beef, chicken and pork. Part of that drop is because
the meat industry has become more industrialized and
consolidated — and like the fashion industry, relies on
cheap labor. Electronics have become dramatically more
affordable as well. But unlike with clothes, few people
have closets stuffed with iPhones.</p>

<img id="girlpile" src="images/haley-lawrence-6ugQ978v-zg-unsplash.jpg" alt="image of group of models">

<p>The average consumer buys 60 percent more
clothing today than 15 years ago, according to the “State
of Fashion 2019” report by McKinsey & Co. and the trade
publication the Business of Fashion. And so, instead of
two adults comfortably fitting their entire wardrobe in
one of those modest prewar closets, folks now require
walk-in closets the size of studio apartments just to
store a wardrobe of shoes. We are clothing gluttons.
Even people who say they don’t care about fashion
still have drawers overstuffed with T-shirts, jeans and
hoodies. In fact, folks who shop for basics may be
the worst offenders of all. Their castoffs aren’t going
to consignment shops or vintage stores. They aren’t
outlasting their first owner and being passed along as an
heirloom. They’re going into landfills.</p>
<p>Each complicated answer eventually spirals
down to consumption. The simplest, best path to
sustainability is not anti-fashion; it’s anti-gorging. And
yet, the same youthful consumers who came of age
in the era of Instagram and who consider clothing old
after only a couple of wearings are among the most
attuned to environmental and social issues. They want
guilt-free newness. That contradiction suggests that
perhaps it’s best to search for that perfect white shirt in
a consignment shop or through a digital resale merchant
such as the RealReal. That would certainly reduce one’s
personal environmental impact. Or maybe the ideal
answer is to rent it. The success of the sharing economy
certainly attests to people’s enthusiasm for this option.
But renting clothes does little to wean us off the belief
that newness is next to godliness. And as Thomas says,
these rented garments must be constantly dry cleaned,
packaged and shipped. While companies can employ
green dry-cleaning processes and limit packaging, the
clothes still have to travel miles upon miles from one
renter to the next.</p>
<p>“It works better on a local scale rather than a
global one because of the carbon footprint,” Thomas
says. A small rental company can make its deliveries
by foot or by bicycle. But then, would the cost to the
customer tick up enough that it would make better
economic sense to simply buy? And if we’re all furiously
renting and consigning, aren’t we still enabling our
gluttony? Maybe just buy less.</p>
<p>That’s what each complicated answer eventually
spirals down to: consumption. The simplest, best path to
sustainability is not anti-fashion; it’s anti-gorging.</p>
<p>The most sustainable white shirt may be cut from
locally grown, organic cotton. It may tick all the boxes for
fair labor practices and a minuscule carbon footprint. But
the best white shirt — the perfect shirt — is the one that
a shopper buys and wears for years. It’s the singular shirt
that stands in lieu of a dozen cheap ones. It is the shirt
that hangs, uncrowded, in a room the size of a closet.
